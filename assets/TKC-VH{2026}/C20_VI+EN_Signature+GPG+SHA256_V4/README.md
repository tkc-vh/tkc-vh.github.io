## 🔐 Cryptographic Methods Used

* **Hash Algorithm:** `SHA-256` *(Algo: RSA 4096)*
* **Digital Signature:** `OpenPGP (GPG)`
* **PGP Fingerprint:** `4099 DAAA 3202 7AAC E7BA C507 5165 E6B6 2628 1F7A`

*All signatures are **detached signatures (`.sig`)**, allowing independent verification without modifying the original files.*

## ✅ Verification Overview

Third parties may independently verify this archive by following these two steps:

### 📍 Step 1 — Check SHA-256 Checksum

**macOS / Linux (Terminal):**
```bash
shasum -a 256 "your_book_file.epub"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Get-FileHash "your_book_file.epub" -Algorithm SHA256
```
> *Compare the computed hash with the matching row in the table below. An exact match confirms the file matches the official release.*

---

### 📍 Step 2 — Verify GPG Signature (`.sig`)

1. **Import the public key** *(one time only)*:
   ```bash
   gpg --import "signatures/TKC-VH-public-key.asc"
   ```
2. **Verify the signature** *(example for EPUB)*:
   ```bash
   gpg --verify "your_book_file.epub.sig" "your_book_file.epub"
   ```

```text
✔️ SHA-256 match   +   ✔️ Valid GPG signature  ⇒  Author-verified original release.
```
*If both the checksum and digital signature are valid, the archive can be considered an authentic record issued by the author.*

## 🏛 Public Archive & Timestamp

This directory is publicly hosted on GitHub. The GitHub commit history serves as an **independent third-party timestamp**, providing additional evidentiary weight for authorship and integrity claims.

---

## ⚖️ Legal Notice

* Any modification to the original content, even a single character, will result in a different SHA-256 hash and invalidate the signatures.
* This archive does **not** grant redistribution rights for the original work. It exists solely for authentication, verification, and legal reference.
