SIGNING INFO — T42C2 (TKC-VH) — OpenPGP / GPG

Work: T42C2 (Complete EPUB & PDF)
Author / Signer: TRAN KHAC CUONG (Pen name: TKC-VH)

Signing standard: OpenPGP (GPG)
Key type: RSA 4096
Key ID: 26281F7A

What these .asc files are:
- Detached signatures (.asc) for each official release file.
- Any change to the signed file (even 1 character, one space, or metadata differences) will cause signature verification to fail.

How to verify (example):
1) Import the public key (one time only):
   gpg --import TKC-VH-public-key.asc

2) Verify a signed file:
   gpg --verify T42C2-EN.epub.asc T42C2-EN.epub
   gpg --verify T42C2-EN.pdf.asc  T42C2-EN.pdf
   gpg --verify T42C2-VI.epub.asc T42C2-VI.epub
   gpg --verify T42C2-VI.pdf.asc  T42C2-VI.pdf

Expected result:
- “Good signature from … (TKC-VH)” means the file matches the author-signed original at signing time.

Repository notes:
- Original EPUB/PDF files may be distributed commercially.
- This folder publishes signatures and the public key to enable independent verification.
