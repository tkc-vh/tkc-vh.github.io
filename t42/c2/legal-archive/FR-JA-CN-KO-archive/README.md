# T42C2 – Multilingual Legal Archive (FR / CN / JA / KO)

This directory contains cryptographic and legal evidence for the
multilingual editions of **T42C2**, covering the following languages:

- French (FR)
- Chinese (CN)
- Japanese (JA)
- Korean (KO)

The purpose of this archive is to provide **public, verifiable proof of
authorship, integrity, and publication timeline** for these editions.

## Scope of this Archive

This archive includes:

- SHA-256 checksum manifest for all FR / CN / JA / KO EPUB and PDF files
- OpenPGP (GPG) detached signatures (`.asc`) for:
  - each individual EPUB and PDF file
  - the global SHA-256 checksum file
  - the compressed legal archive package
- A signed ZIP package preserving the legal archive as a fixed snapshot

The original EPUB and PDF content files are **not included** here.
Only cryptographic evidence is published, in accordance with
academic and archival best practices.

## Relationship to Other Editions

The Vietnamese (VI) and English (EN) editions of **T42C2** were
cryptographically notarized and publicly released **prior** to the
multilingual editions documented in this directory.

This archive therefore **supplements**, and does not replace, the
existing legal records for the VI and EN editions.

All editions belong to the same work series **T42C2** and share
a unified authorship and conceptual origin.

Any third party may independently verify the integrity and authenticity
of the referenced files using standard cryptographic tools:
